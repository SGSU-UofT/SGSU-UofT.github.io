What's expected from a DRP student?
</summary>
Students will be paired with a mentor who will guide them through the reading project. The expectation is that students will conduct independent reading and research, having weekly meeting with their mentor during the winter semester. At the end of the program, students will submit a short write-up summarizing and explaining what they have learned, with the possibility of giving a short presentation.

<summary>
Are there any prerequisites required for the DRP?
</summary>
Although there are no formal prerequisites for the DRP, different mentors may require proficiency in specific topics and will informally suggest prerequisite classes. It is generally assumed that students are comfortable with linear algebra, basic analysis, probability and estimation theory.

<details>
<summary>
Can I choose the topic I want to learn about?
</summary>
Even though the listed topics are guaranteed to be taken up by one of the mentors, we may consider your own personal proposals if you clearly state them in your application.
