title: "Statistics Directed Reading Program"
---

Welcome! This is the official website of the Statistics Directed Reading Program at UofT. Are you interested in research statistics or eager to explore a statistical topic in more depth? Looking for mentorship and the chance to study material you might not encounter in a course? Consider applying to the Directed Reading Program (DRP).

The DRP pairs undergraduate students with graduate mentors in the Department of Statistical Sciences for independent study projects that run through the winter semester. After applying, selected students are matched with mentors based on their interests and goals.

<summary>Who is eligible to participate?</summary>
All UofT undergraduate students who are broadly interested in Statistics are eligible. Although, Statistics majors/specialists will be prioritized in the application process.

<summary>
What's expected from a DRP student?
</summary>
Students will be paired with a mentor who will guide them through the reading project. The expectation is that students will conduct independent reading and research, having weekly or biweekly meetings with their mentor during the winter semester. At the end of the program, students will submit a short write-up summarizing and explaining what they have learned, with the possibility of giving a short presentation.

<summary>
Are there any prerequisites required for the SDRP?
</summary>
Although there are no formal prerequisites for the SDRP, different mentors may require proficiency in specific topics and will informally suggest prerequisite classes. It is generally assumed that students are comfortable with linear algebra, basic analysis, probability and estimation theory.

<summary>
Can I choose the topic I want to learn about?
</summary>
Even though the listed topics were chosen specifically as the mentors' specialties, we may consider your own personal proposals if you are motivated and clearly state them in your application.
