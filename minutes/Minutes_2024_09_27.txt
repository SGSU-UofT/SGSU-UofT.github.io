	- all students attended in-person.

- Previous year executive summary from Mandy Yao as outgoing president.

- Introduction of KC Tsiolis as new president, introduction speech and presentation of new executive team. Review of constitution and goals for the new year.

- Goals
	- Manage the budget surplus inherited from the low spending administrations due to Covid, for which there were a number of proposals, without any consensus (see proposals).

- Proposals
	- Statue in honor of previous generations
	- Making SGSU themed posters (or other themes)
	- Secret Santa
	- Starting a mutual fund of sorts to enhance the financial power of the SGSU
	- Gradual spending on small things rather than looking for a single large expense
	- Pub Nights (noted that these are relatively expensive events)
	- Free food for various events

- Suggestions
 	- Shared platform to centralise funding/grants information for students, which is now mainly sporadic and disorganised. A special focus is required for international students given their historically low involvement in large award competitions amid fewer opportunities.
 	- Revision of Research Day event organisation and decision on which students should be chosen to present.
 	- Organising workshops around public speaking and skills orthogonal to technical knowledge for students.

Most of the key issues remain TBD in future exec team meetings, for which there is a general calling for ideas and enthusiasm from the student body. 

Special thanks to graduating student Rob Zimmerman for continuing his support of the board game party events even after leaving the department.
