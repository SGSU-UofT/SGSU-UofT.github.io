- Statement on the Supporting Children and Students Act, 2025, often referred to as Bill 33.

- KC presents: proposal to create a Directed Reading Program, the details of which are still to be precisely defined and published, but there is clear inspiration from other universities and the Department of Mathematics at UofT. Eight members expressed a potential interest in participating in the program.

- Open forum regarding the two motions of ammendments to the SGSU constitution
	- Presentation and discussion of GSU estimated figures regarding the SGSU Head Grant in both scenarios: with MFI and without MFI students as part of the SGSU.
	- Alternate sources of income were discussed, such as raffles, merchandising etc.
	- Analysis and discussion of MFI timetable and the implied changes in the scheduling of future events to accommodate for them.
	- Many calls to obtain for information on what the MFI's student body interests are and what configuration is actually optimal for the entire student body.
	- Students noted the absence of separation clauses to the addition of the MFIs, forseeing a possible shift in the interests of our two student bodies.
	- Concerns over student ratios in future years that could gratly affect the composition of the SGSU.
	- Many members express favouring reviewing this subject after the MFIs have their own vote and express their views.
	- In fact, there was a very positive attitude towards running joint events to get to meet them, collaborate and increase our synchronisation before an actual adhesion.
	- Noted that the only course in common is STA2503, which is only taken by some Mathematical Finance students.

- Motion 1:
	- Modification in wording for the ammendment proposed by Liam and seconded by KC. The modification passed by simple majority.
	- Voting outcome: Yes 16, No 3, Abstain 0. The motion passes by 2/3 majority.
