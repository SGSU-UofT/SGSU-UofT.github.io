- Previous year executive summary from KC Tsiolis as outgoing president.

- Introduction of Luis Sierra as new president, introduction speech and presentation of new executive team. Review of constitution and goals for the new year.

- Presentation of the new SGSU Sports Club to be headed by PH Chan. This new club aims to formalize and better support the sporting activities sponsored by the SGSU, such as table tennis and chess tournaments, football, badminton, voleyball activities etc.

- Goals
	- Again manage the budget surplus inherited from the low spending administrations due to Covid, for which we inherit the spirit and methodology applied by the previous administration.

- Points raised: 
	- Possible addition of MFI students into the SGSU. These students are paying union fees but are not directly represented by any student body. After review by the executive team, this issue will be brought up in future General Meetings. An early debate took place where the concerns of the students would be the head grant amount, the student governance structure after their possible joining and administrative involvement.
	- Many entries in the Department website are not working or out of date, such as students who already left the department.
	- There may be desks that are still assigned to students who are no longer students in the department.
	- Concern over current and future growth of student body and the capacity of the office to host all PhD students, seeing as how there is currently no space for the MSc students to have desks and the informally communicated growth proyections in the student body would leave no space for all PhD students.

- Proposals
	- SGSU Logo Competition, the details of which will be decided on by the executive team and communicated to the student body.
	- Secret Santa, which will be held in late November/early December.
	- Gradual spending on small things rather than looking for a single large expense.
	- Pub Nights (noted that these are relatively expensive events).
	- Free food for various events such as game nights.

- Suggestions
 	- Desks for MSc students, who currently have no space in the department. The chair communicated a new system was on the brink of being set up.

Many of the issues remain TBD in future exec team meetings, for which there is a general calling for ideas and enthusiasm from the student body.
